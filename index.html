        <p>My name is Rita Ogada. I am an aspiring web developer. I'm currently a civil engineering graduate, but I feel as if 3 years of training has not earned me the much experience I wanted or expected as a Civil Engineer. Hopefully this works
          out, because my main goal in the next 5-10 years is to go into early retirement having several streams of income. I'd like to be a work from home mom. Always there for my kids. To teach them, nuture them, and give them as much attention as
          they'll need or rather, as much as the LORD will help me. My main goal is to walk out of an 8-5 job comfortably with a stable source of income. Money should be the least of my worries.</p>
